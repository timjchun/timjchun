## About me: 

Born and based in Maryland, USA near the Washington DC Metropolitan. I have a BS in Community Health from the University of Maryland College Park from 2016.

I am a researcher with interest in data management and database development. I spent 8 years working for the War Related Illness and Injury Study Center where I was able to grow as a researcher and data manager.

During my time at the WRIISC I specialized in military exposures research and post-deployment health concerns amongst 1990-1991 Gulf War Veterans. 

I also spent time researching traumatic brain injuries amongst veteran populations, in particular the Explosive Ordinance Disposal military personnel.

I am proud to have been a public servant and serving the country by trying to improve the lives of Veterans and providing a foundation for future researchers who want to dive into Veteran research. Veterans have had distrust, poor experiences, and difficulty navigating the VA system and I am proud that I was able to help Veterans have a positive experience and regain trust within the VA system.

I hope this page will give additional insight into who I am.

## Hobbies and Personal Interests
I have a passion of outdoor bouldering and board climbing. I have a long term goal of sending local Maryland Boulders and documenting the journey. I spend most of my time training on the Tension Board and Spray Wall.

I grew up with a passion with sound design. During my early twenties, I learned how to create software instruments from Foley (found sounds) which was used for sound design and ambient music. I primarily use Ableton Live.

I have a passion in Cinematography. I love the history of Cinema Lens and am excited for the current Cinema Lens environment. 

I use BlackMagic Design's Davinci Resolve for color grading and editing. My current gear is BlackMagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4K and Original. I primarily use Sirui 35mm Anamorphic Lens.
